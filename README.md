# Wind-Farm-Layout-Optimization

Aim 

Improve upon an already existing computational model that optimizes the positions of wind turbines in a wind farm with respect to its cost-power ratio. This is to be achieved by adapting existing methods or adding new features to improve the accuracy and performance of the model. 

Objectives 

Below are the projects objectives which were completed over its duration. Several project ideas were put forth based on previous students’ recommendations as well as some original ideas. A handful of them were selected via a decision matrix resulting in the following project objectives: 

*Review and update existing datasets and costing parameters where possible to maintain the tools relevancy. 

*Develop the model to be more marketable by adding in a payback time function. 

*Research and implement the costs associated with existing wind turbine foundations. 

*Find a more effective method of calculating the area that the turbines in the wind farm occupy hence creating a more accurate land cost value. 

*Allow the computational tool to be more user friendly by designing a user interface. 

*Improve the model’s realism by adding in a cabling connection between the substation and the shoreline.
